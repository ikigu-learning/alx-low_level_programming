## Arguments to main function

Covered argc and argv parameters

## Advanced problem

The problem in 100-change.c was a non-mandatory advanced problem. It wanted me find a way to give the fewest number of coins as change.

Other problems in this project deal with getting the number of arguments passed and printing them, adding & multiplying the values passed as arguments.
