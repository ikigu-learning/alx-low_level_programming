In this project, I'll be Learning about memory allocation on the heap, using the "malloc" and "free" library functions. These are the functions I'm required to create.

0-create_array.c - a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.

1-strdup.c - a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

2-str_concat.c - a function that concatenates two strings

3-alloc_grid.c - a function that returns a pointer to a two-dimensional array of integers

4-free_grid.c - a function that frees the two-dimensional grid previously created by the alloc_grid function (3 above)
