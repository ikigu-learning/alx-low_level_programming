## Malloc and free

In this project, I learnt about memory allocation on the heap, using the `malloc` and `free` library functions.

## Problem set

1. **0-create_array.c** - Create a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.

2. **1-strdup.c** - Create a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

3. **2-str_concat.c** - Create a function that concatenates two strings

4. **3-alloc_grid.c** - Create a function that returns a pointer to a two-dimensional array of integers.

**4-free_grid.c** - Create a function that frees the two-dimensional grid previously created by the alloc_grid function (4 above).
