# File I/O

In this project, I covered the following concepts

1. File descriptors
2. System calls

## Problem set

1. **0-read_textfile.c**: Write a function that reads a text file and prints its contents to the standard output.
2. **1-create_file.c**: Write a function that creates a file and adds some text to it.
3. **2-append_text_to_file**: Write a function that appends some text to the end of a file.
4. **3-cp.c**: a function that copies the contents of one file to another. Works as `cp file_from file_to` would work on UNIX-like systems.
