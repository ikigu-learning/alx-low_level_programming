# ALX Low-Level Programming

A deep dive into low level programming concepts!

Starting October, 2023, I undertook the software engineering course offered by ALX. In the first sprint (Oct to Dec), we mainly covered low-level programming concepts in C. This repository contains my solutions for the problem sets we were presented.

## Concepts covered in C

1. C first statements (Hello World!)
2. Variables & if...else if...else
3. Functions and nested loops
4. Debugging
5. Pointers, arrays & strings
6. Recursion
7. Static libraries
8. Variadic functions
9. Argc & Argv
10. Memory management in the heap
11. Preprocessing
12. C structures & typedef
13. Function pointers
14. Singly-linked-lists
15. Bit manipulation
16. File I/O
17. Doubly-linked lists
18. Dynamic libraries

## Main functions

A lot of the problem sets didn't require me to create an entry point to the program, the `main()` function. ALX has an automatic checker that would pull the code from my Github repo and compile with other files needed to create test programs (file with the main included). The checker would then run these programs and ascertain that they gave the correct outputs.
