# ALX Low-Level Programming

A deep dive into low level programming concepts!

Starting October, 2023, I undertook the software engineering course offered by ALX. In the first sprint (Oct to Dec), we mainly covered low-level programming concepts in C. This repository contains my solutions for the problems we were presented.

## Concepts learned

1. C first statements (Hello World!)
2. Variables & if...else if...else
3. Functions and nested loops
4. Debugging
5. Pointers, arrays & strings
6. Recursion
7. Static libraries
8. Variadic functions
9. Argc & Argv
10. Memory management in the heap
11. Preprocessing
12. C structures & typedef
13. Function pointers
14. Singly-linked-lists
15. Bit manipulation
16. File I/O
